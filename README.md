In this project I used different regression algorithms to predict weekly sales for walmart. I used Kaggles free GPUs and Datasets in this competion. Those different algorithms include random forrest, decision tree, xgboost and so on. Initially I used feature engineering and used data visualization techniques to get my data into the best shape.
